# SeaRho - Spartan Edge Accelerator Retro Hobbyists' Oasis

The goal of the SeaRho project is to turn the [Spartan Edge Accelerator Board](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Spartan-Edge-Accelerator-Board-p-4261.html) (SEA) into a fun and capable retro gaming and computing platform.

In physics, the greek letter rho ('œÅ') often represents density, which SeaRho embodies by packing rich functionality into relatively small FPGA cores (as compared to the [MiSTer](https://misterfpga.org/) project).

This repository contains source code for ESP32 firmware and startup FPGA cores designed for the Spartan Edge Accelerator.
